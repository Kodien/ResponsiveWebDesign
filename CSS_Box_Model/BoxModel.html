        <!-- In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box with 4 areas -->
        <!-- The content is like the item inside your package, in our case, it's our headings and text -->
        <!-- The content is surrounded by a padding, similar to a bubble wrap separates an item from the box around it -->\
        <!-- The border is like a cardboard box where your item was shipped in -->
        <!-- Margin is the area outside the box, can be used to control the space between the box and other elements -->
